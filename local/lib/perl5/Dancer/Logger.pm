=head1 NAME

Dancer::Logger - common interface for logging in Dancer

=head1 VERSION

version 1.3513

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is the wrapper that provides support for different 
logger engines.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Default engine

The setting B<logger> defines which logger engine to use. 
If this setting is not set, logging will not be available in the application
code.

Dancer comes with the logger engines L<Dancer::Logger::File> and
L<Dancer::Logger::Console>, but more are available on the CPAN.

=head2 Configuration

The B<logger> configuration variable tells Dancer which engine to use.

You can change it either in your config.yml file:

    # logging to console
    logger: "console"

Or in the application code:

    # logging to file 
    set logger => 'file';

The log format can also be configured, 
please see L<Dancer::Logger::Abstract/"logger_format"> for details.

=head2 Auto-serializing

The loggers allow auto-serializing of all inputs:

    debug( 'User credentials: ', \%creds );

Will provide you with an output in a single log message of the string and the
reference dump.

=head1 AUTHORS

This module has been written by Alexis Sukrieh. See the AUTHORS file that comes
with this distribution for details.

=head1 LICENSE

This module is free software and is released under the same terms as Perl
itself.

=head1 SEE ALSO

See L<Dancer> for details about the complete framework.

You can also search the CPAN for existing engines in the Dancer::Logger
namespace : L<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Dancer%3A%3ALogger>.
