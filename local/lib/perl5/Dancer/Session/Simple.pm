=head1 NAME

Dancer::Session::Simple - in-memory session backend for Dancer

=head1 VERSION

version 1.3513

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a very simple session backend, holding all session data
in memory.  This means that sessions are volatile, and no longer exist when the
process exits.  This module is likely to be most useful for testing purposes.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The setting B<session> should be set to C<Simple> in order to use this session
engine in a Dancer application.

=head1 AUTHOR

This module has been written by David Precious, see the AUTHORS file for
details.

=head1 SEE ALSO

See L<Dancer::Session> for details about session usage in route handlers.
