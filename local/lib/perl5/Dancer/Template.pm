=head1 NAME

Dancer::Template - template wrapper for Dancer

=head1 VERSION

version 1.3513

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is the wrapper that provides support for different 
template engines.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Default engine

The default engine used by Dancer::Template is L<< Dancer::Template::Simple >>.
If you want to change the engine used, you have to edit the B<template>
configuration variable.

=head2 Configuration

The B<template> configuration variable tells Dancer which engine to use
for rendering views.

You change it either in your config.yml file:

    # setting TT as the template engine
    template: "template_toolkit" 

Or in the application code:

    # setting TT as the template engine
    set template => 'template_toolkit';
