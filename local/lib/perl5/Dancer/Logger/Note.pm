=head1 NAME

Dancer::Logger::Note - Test::More note() logging engine for Dancer

=head1 VERSION

version 1.3513

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This logging engine uses L<Test::More>'s note() to output as TAP comments.

This is very useful in case you're writing a test and want to have logging
messages as part of your TAP.

"Like C<diag()>, except the message will not be seen when the test is run in a
harness. It will only be visible in the verbose TAP stream." -- Test::More.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init

This method is called when C<< ->new() >> is called. It just loads Test::More
lazily.

=head2 _log

Use Test::More's note() to output the log message.
